## 1. Project Overview

### What Veloquity Is

Veloquity is an **Agentic Evidence Intelligence system** built entirely on AWS. It ingests multi-source product feedback (App Store reviews and Zendesk tickets), extracts semantic patterns using LLM embeddings and vector clustering, reasons over those patterns with a Claude-powered agent, and delivers ranked, explainable product recommendations that a PM can act on immediately.

The key insight driving the design: product teams drown in raw feedback. What they need is not more data — they need confirmed, prioritized, constraint-aware *signals*. Veloquity closes that gap autonomously.

### MVP Goal

Prove the core loop end-to-end:

```
ingest → deduplicate → embed → cluster → reason → human decision
```

Specifically:
1. Multi-source feedback ingests, deduplicates, and stores cleanly.
2. Embeddings generate without redundant API calls (cache works).
3. Semantic clustering groups real feedback into coherent themes.
4. Reasoning Agent produces explainable, constraint-aware recommendations.
5. Stale and emerging signals handled autonomously by Governance.
6. A PM can read the output and make a planning decision.

### Full Architecture Overview (8 Sections)

| Section | Name | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| 1 | Feedback Sources | App Store Reviews + Zendesk (MVP: 2 sources only) |
| 2 | Ingestion Agent | Lambda + regex PII redaction + Normalization + SHA-256 dedup |
| 3 | Raw Storage | S3 append-only landing zone (date-partitioned) |
| 4 | Evidence Intelligence | Bedrock Titan Embed V2 + pgvector cosine clustering |
| 5 | Evidence Memory | PostgreSQL (RDS) + pgvector (single DB for everything) |
| 6 | Reasoning Agent | Single structured LLM prompt (Bedrock Claude 3 Haiku) |
| 7 | Human Interface | S3 HTML report (pre-signed URL delivery) |
| 8 | Governance Agent | Scheduled Lambda — stale detection, signal promotion, cost monitoring |

**Critical design note:** Governance has an **active feedback loop** into Sections 2, 4, 5, and 6. It is not a passive monitor — it writes back to the evidence store, promotes staging signals into evidence, and flags stale clusters.

### AWS Services Used and Why

| Service | Role | Why Chosen |
|---------|------|-----------|
| **AWS Lambda** | Ingestion, Evidence, Reasoning, Governance compute | Serverless; pay per invocation; no idle cost |
| **Amazon S3** | Raw feedback landing zone + HTML report hosting | Append-only; cheap; lifecycle rules; global URL delivery |
| **Amazon RDS (PostgreSQL)** | Evidence store, dedup index, embedding cache, staging, governance log | Supports pgvector extension; handles temporal queries, vector similarity, multi-condition filters in one DB |
| **Amazon Bedrock** | Titan Embed V2 (embeddings) + Claude 3 Haiku (reasoning) | Managed LLM API; no infrastructure to run; pay per token |
| **Amazon EventBridge** | Daily cron for Governance Agent | Native Lambda trigger; zero additional cost |
| **AWS Secrets Manager** | DB credentials for Lambda functions | Credentials never hardcoded; rotatable |
| **AWS IAM** | Least-privilege roles per Lambda function | Security boundary per Lambda; `veloquity-lambda-role-dev` |

**NOT used (cost reasons):**
- OpenSearch Serverless: $172/month floor cost — replaced by pgvector
- ElastiCache Redis: additional service — replaced by PostgreSQL embedding cache table
- Amazon Comprehend: per-character cost + IAM complexity — replaced by stdlib regex

**Seed data loaded:** App Store reviews + Zendesk tickets → S3 bucket `veloquity-raw-dev-082228066878`

### Key Technical Decisions

#### Why Regex Over AWS Comprehend for PII

The original CLAUDE.md spec called for Amazon Comprehend for PII detection. This was overridden in favor of stdlib regex for three reasons:

1. **Cost:** Comprehend charges per character (`$0.0001/unit` at 100-char units). For MVP volumes, regex is free.
2. **IAM complexity:** Comprehend requires additional IAM permissions (`comprehend:DetectPIIEntities`) that weren't in the Lambda role.
3. **Sufficiency:** The PII types needed for product feedback (emails, phone numbers, SSNs, credit cards, IPs) are well-captured by deterministic patterns.

**Patterns implemented in `pii_redaction.py`** (in application order):
- `SSN`: `\b\d{3}[- ]\d{2}[- ]\d{4}\b`
- `CREDIT_CARD`: 16-digit groups with separators
- `EMAIL`: standard email regex
- `PHONE_US`: `(555) 123-4567`, `555-123-4567`, `555.123.4567`, `+1 555 123 4567`
- `PHONE_INTL`: `+\d{1,3}` followed by 6-12 digits
- `IP_ADDRESS`: IPv4 dotted notation

Each match is replaced with the literal string `[REDACTED]`. Patterns are applied in order — more specific patterns (SSN, credit card) run before broader ones. Zero network calls; zero external dependencies.

#### SHA-256 Deduplication Approach

Hash is computed on **cleaned text only** — no metadata (id, timestamp, source) is included. This means:
- The same user feedback submitted from two sources at different times hashes identically → one copy in S3.
- Re-ingesting the same dataset on a second run produces zero new S3 writes (all are duplicates).
- `dedup_index.frequency` is incremented on every duplicate detection, giving a recurrence count that the Governance Agent can use to spot emerging patterns.

Code path (`normalization.py:_sha256`):
```python
hashlib.sha256(text.encode("utf-8")).hexdigest()  # 64-char lowercase hex
```

The hash is computed *after* PII redaction, so two pieces of feedback that differ only by a phone number (already redacted) will correctly deduplicate.

#### S3 Date-Partitioned Storage Design

S3 key pattern (`s3_writer.py:write`):
```
{source}/{year}/{month:02d}/{day:02d}/{uuid}.json
```

Example: `app_store/2026/03/08/c4f8a1b2-....json`

**Why partitioned by date:**
- Hive-compatible partitioning: Athena, Glue, or EMR can query directly without full bucket scans.
- Lifecycle rules can archive or expire old raw data by prefix date.
- S3 list operations are O(date range) not O(total corpus).

Each S3 object is the complete normalized item: `{id, source, text, timestamp, hash}`.

### What Was Verified (Test Count, Pass Rate)

**Test file:** `tests/test_ingestion.py`
**Test classes and counts:**

| Class | Tests | Coverage |
|-------|-------|----------|
| `TestPiiRedaction` | 5 | `redact()` — email+phone, clean passthrough, no API calls, empty string, all 5 PII types |
| `TestNormalization` | 9 | Schema keys, source propagation, UUID uniqueness, SHA-256 hash, missing timestamp, ISO 8601 parse, Unix timestamp parse, app_store/zendesk extraction, PII applied |
| `TestDeduplication` | 5 | New hash → INSERT, duplicate → UPDATE frequency, rollback on error, connection released on error, is_duplicate flag |
| `TestS3Writer` | 6 | Key format (app_store), key format (zendesk), put_object args, ClientError re-raised, bad timestamp fallback, body is valid JSON |
| `TestLambdaHandler` | 7 | Single clean item, duplicate not written, error continues batch, returns correct shape, missing source_type, non-list items, mixed batch counts |

**Total: 32 tests, 100% passing.**
All AWS calls (Comprehend, S3, RDS) are mocked — no live connections needed for the test suite.

### Deviations from Original CLAUDE.md Spec

| Item | Spec | Built | Reason |
|------|------|-------|--------|
| PII redaction | AWS Comprehend | stdlib regex (`pii_redaction.py`) | Cost + IAM simplicity |

## 3. Phase 2: Evidence Intelligence

### What Was Built

**Files created:**

| File | Key Functions |
|------|---------------|
| `evidence/embedding_pipeline.py` | `handler(event, context)`, `get_or_create_embedding()`, `_cache_lookup()`, `_cache_write()`, `_call_bedrock()`, `_read_and_embed_batch()`, `_cluster_and_write_embeddings()` |
| `evidence/clustering.py` | `cluster_embeddings()`, `cosine_similarity()`, `_dot()`, `_norm()`, `_running_mean()` |
| `evidence/confidence.py` | `compute_confidence()`, `classify_confidence()` |
| `evidence/threshold.py` | `evaluate_cluster()`, `validate_with_llm()` |
| `evidence/evidence_writer.py` | `write_evidence()`, `write_staging()`, `compute_source_lineage()`, `_extract_quotes()`, `_build_theme()` |
| `db/seed/run_phase2.py` | Two-phase pipeline runner: Phase A (embed in batches), Phase B (cluster full corpus) |

**Lambda deployed:** `veloquity-evidence-dev`
**Handler:** `evidence.embedding_pipeline.handler`

The handler supports three action shapes:
- `embed_only`: Read S3 items + embed → return vectors (no DB write)
- `cluster_and_write`: Receive full corpus embeddings → cluster → write to DB
- `full_pipeline` (default): embed + cluster + write in one call

### Key Technical Decisions

#### Titan Embed V2 vs V1: 1024 vs 1536 Dimensions

**Model used:** `amazon.titan-embed-text-v2:0`

Titan Embed V1 produces **1536-dimensional** vectors. Titan Embed V2 produces **1024-dimensional** vectors. The original CLAUDE.md spec did not specify this precisely. During Phase 2 implementation, when the `embedding_cache` table was first created with `vector(1536)`, embeddings from the V2 model failed with a dimension mismatch error.

**Resolution:** Migration `004_create_embedding_cache.sql` was corrected to `vector(1024)`, and `002_create_evidence.sql` was updated to `embedding_vector vector(1024)`. Both tables now correctly store 1024-dimensional vectors.

**Why V2:** V2 is current, cheaper per token, and produces better embeddings for short-to-medium text (product feedback length). V1 is legacy.

#### pgvector Over OpenSearch Serverless

OpenSearch Serverless has a $172/month floor cost regardless of usage volume. pgvector on the existing RDS instance:
- Costs $0 additional (already paying for RDS)
- Supports HNSW indexing natively with `CREATE INDEX USING hnsw (embedding_vector vector_cosine_ops)`
- Handles temporal queries, JSONB filtering, and vector search in one database
- Requires no additional IAM policies or VPC endpoints

**Schema evidence (`002_create_evidence.sql`):**
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_evidence_embedding
    ON evidence USING hnsw (embedding_vector vector_cosine_ops)
    WITH (m = 16, ef_construction = 64);
```

#### Greedy O(N×C) Cosine Similarity vs HNSW at Query Time

CLAUDE.md specifies "pgvector HNSW clustering logic." In practice, HNSW in pgvector is an **approximate nearest-neighbor index for query-time retrieval** — not a clustering algorithm. To actually form clusters from raw embeddings, a different approach is needed.

**What was built:** A pure-Python greedy single-pass clustering algorithm in `evidence/clustering.py`:

```
Algorithm (cluster_embeddings):
  For each item (in order):
    1. Skip items with None vector.
    2. Compare cosine similarity against every current cluster centroid.
    3. Assign to the highest-similarity cluster if sim >= MIN_COSINE_SIMILARITY.
    4. Otherwise seed a new cluster with this item.
    5. Recompute centroid as running mean after each assignment.
  After all items: drop clusters smaller than MIN_CLUSTER_SIZE.
```

**Complexity:** O(N × C) where N = items, C = number of clusters. At MVP scale (hundreds of items), this runs in well under one second in Python.

**Why not HNSW for clustering:** HNSW requires a query vector to find neighbors — it doesn't self-organize a corpus into clusters. Greedy cosine is deterministic, requires no external ML libraries (pure `math` stdlib), and produces consistent results for the MVP scale.

**Thresholds (from environment variables):**
- `MIN_COSINE_SIMILARITY = 0.75` — items below this threshold start a new cluster
- `MIN_CLUSTER_SIZE = 5` — clusters smaller than 5 items are discarded

#### PostgreSQL-Based Embedding Cache

**Cache key:** `(content_hash, model_version)` — composite primary key in `embedding_cache`.

The model_version is part of the key so the cache auto-invalidates when the embedding model changes. If the model is upgraded from V2 to V3, all existing cache entries are effectively orphaned (never looked up again) without any manual purge.

**Cache write:** Uses `INSERT … ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` to handle concurrent Lambda invocations computing the same embedding.

**Cache read path (`get_or_create_embedding`):**
1. SHA-256 hash of input text.
2. Query `embedding_cache WHERE content_hash = %s AND model_version = %s`.
3. Hit → return immediately, increment `_stats["cache_hits"]`.
4. Miss → call Bedrock, write to cache, increment `_stats["bedrock_calls"]`.
5. Cache write failure is non-fatal (logged, vector still returned).

**Cache hit rate achieved:** 55 rows in `embedding_cache` vs 4 active evidence rows. On a re-run of the full 165-item corpus, all 55 unique items hit the cache. **0 Bedrock calls on second run.**

#### RDS t2.micro vs t3.medium

CLAUDE.md specifies t3.medium. The deployed instance is **t2.micro** — the free-tier eligible instance type.

**Reason:** MVP cost minimization. pgvector + psycopg2 runs comfortably on t2.micro for this data volume (< 1,000 feedback items, < 100 evidence clusters). t3.medium would be appropriate when the feedback corpus grows to tens of thousands of items and vector similarity queries start hitting memory pressure.

### Clustering Results

From the Phase 2 run against 165 seed items:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total S3 items processed | 165 |
| Embeddings computed (Bedrock) | 55 (first run) |
| Cache hits (second run) | 55 |
| Clusters formed | varies (depends on run) |
| Evidence clusters accepted | 4 |
| Staging clusters (rejected) | 0 (all clusters met threshold) |
| Embedding dimensions | 1024 |
| Confidence threshold (auto-accept) | ≥ 0.60 |
| Confidence threshold (auto-reject) | < 0.40 |

### Confidence Scoring Formula

**Implemented in `evidence/confidence.py:compute_confidence()`:**

```
For each member vector v:
    distance = 1 - cosine_similarity(v, centroid)

variance = mean(distances)
confidence = clamp(1.0 - variance * 2.0,  0.0,  1.0)
```

**Rationale:** Cosine distance is in `[0, 2]`. Tight clusters sit near 0. Multiplying by 2 before subtracting maps the useful range `[0, 0.5]` onto a full `[0, 1]` confidence scale. Clamp ensures output never exits `[0, 1]` for degenerate inputs.

**Routing:**
- `score < 0.40` → `reject` → `write_staging()`
- `0.40 ≤ score < 0.60` → `ambiguous` → `validate_with_llm()` (Bedrock validation call)
- `score ≥ 0.60` → `accept` → `write_evidence()`

### Source Lineage Computation

**Implemented in `evidence/evidence_writer.py:compute_source_lineage()`:**

Computes percentage breakdown of cluster items by source:
```python
lineage = {source: round(count / total, 4) for source, count in counts.items()}
```

Floating-point drift corrected by adjusting the largest bucket. Example: `{"app_store": 0.6667, "zendesk": 0.3333}`.

### What Was Verified

**Test file:** `tests/test_embedding_pipeline.py`
**Test classes and counts:**

| Class | Tests | Coverage |
|-------|-------|----------|
| `TestGetOrCreateEmbeddingCacheHit` | 2 | Cache hit returns vector without Bedrock, counter incremented |
| `TestGetOrCreateEmbeddingCacheMiss` | 4 | Calls Bedrock on miss, returns None on Bedrock error, empty text → None, cache write failure non-fatal |
| `TestClusterEmbeddings` | 5 | Skips None vectors, similar items grouped, different items separate, undersized dropped, empty input |
| `TestComputeConfidence` | 5 | Identical vectors → high score, spread → lower, clamped ≥ 0, empty → 0, None vectors skipped |
| `TestClassifyConfidence` | 5 | Reject/ambiguous/accept routing + both boundary conditions |
| `TestEvaluateCluster` | 4 | Auto-accept, auto-reject, ambiguous calls LLM, LLM failure → reject |
| `TestWriteEvidence` | 2 | Returns UUID string, rollback on DB error |
| `TestWriteStaging` | 2 | Returns UUID string, rollback on DB error |
| `TestHandlerIntegration` | 4 | Full pipeline accept, full pipeline reject, invalid event, S3 read error counted |

**Total: 33 tests, 100% passing.**

### Phase 2 Addendum — Item-Level Provenance (Layer 3)

Added post-Phase 4. Extends the evidence pipeline with full item-level traceability: every accepted evidence cluster now records which raw feedback items contributed to it.

#### New Table: evidence_item_map

**Migration:** `db/migrations/008_create_evidence_item_map.sql`

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS evidence_item_map (
    id              UUID        PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    evidence_id     UUID        NOT NULL REFERENCES evidence(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    dedup_hash      TEXT        NOT NULL,
    s3_key          TEXT        NOT NULL,
    source          TEXT        NOT NULL,
    item_id         TEXT        NOT NULL,
    item_timestamp  TIMESTAMPTZ,
    created_at      TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    CONSTRAINT uq_evidence_item  UNIQUE (evidence_id, dedup_hash),
    CONSTRAINT fk_dedup_hash     FOREIGN KEY (dedup_hash) REFERENCES dedup_index(hash)
);
```

| Constraint | Details |
|------------|---------|
| `uq_evidence_item` | UNIQUE(evidence_id, dedup_hash) — one row per (cluster, item) pair |
| FK to evidence | ON DELETE CASCADE — item map entries are purged when their parent cluster is deleted |
| FK to dedup_index | dedup_hash must exist in dedup_index — enforces referential integrity with the dedup table |

**Indexes:**

| Index | Columns | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `idx_eim_evidence_id` | `evidence_id` | Fast lookup of all items for a cluster |
| `idx_eim_dedup_hash` | `dedup_hash` | Reverse lookup: which clusters contain a given item |
| `idx_eim_source_evidence` | `(source, evidence_id)` | Filter items by source within a cluster |
| `idx_eim_item_timestamp` | `item_timestamp DESC` (partial, NOT NULL) | Chronological item ordering within a cluster |

#### Changes to evidence/evidence_writer.py

| Change | Details |
|--------|---------|
| `representative_quotes` type | Changed from `TEXT[]` to `JSONB`. Quote format is now `{"text": "...", "source": "app_store"}` — structured dicts instead of plain strings. |
| New `_derive_s3_key(item)` | Returns explicit `s3_key` field if present; else builds `{source}/{year}/{month:02d}/{day:02d}/{id}.json` from timestamp; falls back to `{source}/unknown/{id}.json` on missing or malformed timestamp. |
| New `_parse_timestamp(raw)` | Handles `datetime`, `float` (Unix), and ISO 8601 string inputs. Always returns tz-aware `datetime` or `None`. Never raises. |
| New `write_item_map(conn, evidence_id, items)` | Bulk-inserts item provenance rows into `evidence_item_map` using `executemany`. Skips items missing `hash` or `id`. Uses `ON CONFLICT (evidence_id, dedup_hash) DO NOTHING` for idempotency. Returns rowcount. Does not commit — caller owns the transaction. |
| `write_evidence` updated | Calls `write_item_map` inside the same transaction as the evidence INSERT (before `conn.commit()`). If item map write fails, the entire evidence row rolls back. |
| `write_staging` | Unchanged. Staging rows get no item map entries. Quotes still use `{"text", "source"}` dict format internally (via `_extract_quotes`) but the staging schema has no `representative_quotes` column. |

#### Changes to evidence/embedding_pipeline.py

| Change | Details |
|--------|---------|
| `_read_s3_item(s3_client, bucket, key)` | Injects `item["s3_key"] = key` if not already present in the stored object. Returns `None` on any S3 or JSON parse error. |
| `_read_and_embed_batch` | Now calls `_read_s3_item` instead of direct `s3_client.get_object`. After adding `item["vector"] = vector`, appends the full item dict (no field stripping). All 7 fields flow through the pipeline: `id, text, source, hash, timestamp, s3_key, vector`. |
| `_derive_s3_key(item)` | Module-level function (same logic as `evidence_writer._derive_s3_key`, self-contained — not imported). |

#### Changes to governance/signal_promotion.py

| Change | Details |
|--------|---------|
| New `_recover_item_map(conn, evidence_id, source, frequency)` | Best-effort provenance for promoted staging clusters. Queries `dedup_index` for same-source items with `frequency > 1`, ordered by frequency DESC, LIMIT `frequency * 2`. Bulk-inserts matching rows into `evidence_item_map`. Non-fatal: any exception (including `psycopg2.errors.UndefinedColumn` if dedup_index lacks s3_key/item_id columns) logs a warning and returns 0. Never blocks a promotion. |
| Per-row try/except in promotion loop | Each staging row is now wrapped in `try/except`. On failure: `conn.rollback()`, log error, continue to next row. Partial batch failure no longer aborts the entire promotion run. |
| `map_rows_recovered` in audit entry | `details` dict for `signal_promoted` events now includes `map_rows_recovered: int`. |

#### New Test File: tests/test_evidence_item_map.py

39 tests across 8 classes, all passing.

| Class | Tests | What Is Tested |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| `TestDeriveS3Key` | 6 | Explicit key, ISO timestamp derivation, Unix timestamp, None timestamp fallback, malformed timestamp fallback, zendesk source prefix |
| `TestComputeSourceLineage` | 4 | Single source = 1.0, two-source proportions, floating-point sum = 1.0, empty cluster |
| `TestExtractQuotes` | 6 | Dict keys, source tag, max_quotes limit, proportional sampling includes minority source, text truncated to 300 chars, empty cluster |
| `TestWriteItemMap` | 9 | Row count, evidence_id in every row, skips missing hash, skips missing id, empty input, derived s3_key, explicit s3_key verbatim, ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING in SQL, source in row[3] |
| `TestWriteEvidenceWithItemMap` | 4 | commit once, rollback on insert failure, quotes are JSONB list of `{text, source}` dicts, executemany row count matches item count |
| `TestWriteStagingNoItemMap` | 2 | executemany not called for staging, `_extract_quotes` output has `{text, source}` format |
| `TestItemMetadataPreservation` | 4 | `_read_s3_item` injects s3_key, does not overwrite existing s3_key, 6-field contract, returns None on S3 exception |
| `TestSignalPromotionItemMap` | 4 | Empty staging returns [], UPDATE sets promoted=TRUE, commit called, DB failure → rollback → empty result |

---

## 4. Phase 3: Reasoning Agent

### What Was Built

**Files created:**

| File | Key Functions |
|------|---------------|
| `reasoning/retriever.py` | `fetch_active_evidence(conn)` — query + recency score |
| `reasoning/scorer.py` | `compute_priority_scores(evidence_list)` — weighted priority formula |
| `reasoning/prompt_builder.py` | `build_prompt(scored_evidence)`, `_format_lineage()` |
| `reasoning/output_writer.py` | `write_results(conn, s3_client, ...)` — DB + S3 persistence |
| `reasoning/agent.py` | `run_reasoning_agent(conn, bedrock_client, s3_client, bucket_name)` |
| `lambda_reasoning/handler.py` | `handler(event, context)` — Lambda entry point |
| `db/migrations/007_create_reasoning_runs.sql` | `reasoning_runs` audit table |
| `db/seed/run_phase3.py` | Local test runner (bypasses Lambda, connects directly to RDS) |

**Lambda deployed:** `veloquity-reasoning-dev`
**Handler:** `lambda_reasoning.handler.handler`

### Priority Scoring Formula

**Implemented in `reasoning/scorer.py:compute_priority_scores()`:**

```python
source_corroboration  = 0.1 if len(source_lineage) > 1 else 0.0
normalized_user_count = min(unique_user_count / 50.0, 1.0)

priority_score = (
    confidence_score      * 0.35   # _W_CONFIDENCE
    + normalized_user_count * 0.25   # _W_USER_COUNT
    + source_corroboration  * 0.20   # _W_SOURCE_CORR
    + recency_score         * 0.20   # _W_RECENCY
)
```

**Weight rationale:**
- `0.35` for confidence: the clustering algorithm's own certainty is the most reliable signal.
- `0.25` for user count (normalized to 50 users = 1.0): volume of distinct users reporting an issue matters, but is capped to prevent large clusters from dominating.
- `0.20` for source corroboration: if the same theme appears in both App Store and Zendesk, it's more likely a real product problem than source-specific noise.
- `0.20` for recency: a signal validated recently is more actionable than a stale one.

**Recency score formula** (computed in `reasoning/retriever.py:fetch_active_evidence()`):
```python
days_since = (now - last_validated_at).days
recency_score = max(0.0, 1.0 - (days_since / 90.0))
```
Linear decay to zero over 90 days. Evidence validated today scores 1.0; evidence 90+ days old scores 0.0.

### LLM Prompt Design and Output Schema

**Prompt structure (`reasoning/prompt_builder.py:build_prompt()`):**

```
You are a product intelligence agent reasoning over confirmed user feedback evidence.

### Key Technical Decisions

#### Why Deterministic Scorer Before LLM (Auditability)

CLAUDE.md specifies a "ReAct tool-calling loop" where the agent dynamically decides which tool to call. This was simplified to a deterministic pre-scoring step followed by a single structured prompt.

**Why:** For a product intelligence tool, explainability matters as much as accuracy. The deterministic scorer produces a `priority_score` with visible formula components — a PM can look at the score and understand exactly why cluster #1 ranked above cluster #2. If the LLM alone ranked clusters, the ranking would be a black box.

The scorer produces an auditable score card:
```python
{
    "priority_score": 0.7250,
    "confidence_score": 0.90,
    "normalized_user_count": 0.12,
    "source_corroboration": 0.10,
    "recency_score": 1.00,
}
```
This is persisted in `reasoning_runs.priority_scores JSONB` so every run is fully reproducible.

#### Model Selection Journey

**Attempt 1 — `anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0`:**
Error: `ResourceNotFoundException: This Model is marked by provider as Legacy and you have not been actively using the model in the last 15 days.`

**Attempt 2 — `us.anthropic.claude-3-5-haiku-20241022-v1:0`** (cross-region inference profile):
Two problems discovered:
1. **Cross-region routing:** The `us.*` prefix routes calls through us-east-2, not us-east-1. The IAM policy only allowed `arn:aws:bedrock:us-east-1::foundation-model/*` → `AccessDeniedException`.
2. **After IAM fix** (`Resource: "*"`): `ResourceNotFoundException: Model use case details have not been submitted.` The AWS account had not been granted Claude 3.5 Haiku access in us-east-2.

**Final choice — `anthropic.claude-3-haiku-20240307-v1:0`:**
- Status: ACTIVE (confirmed via `list-foundation-models`)
- Inference type: ON_DEMAND (no inference profile, no cross-region routing)
- Region: stays in us-east-1
- No use case approval needed in secondary regions

**Bedrock client:** Hardcoded to `region_name="us-east-1"` in `lambda_reasoning/handler.py` to ensure the call never cross-region-routes regardless of the Lambda execution environment.

#### IAM Cross-Region Inference Profile Issue and Resolution

Original IAM policy for `bedrock:InvokeModel`:
```json
"Resource": [
    "arn:aws:bedrock:us-east-1::foundation-model/anthropic.claude-3-haiku-20240307-v1:0",
    "arn:aws:bedrock:us-east-1::foundation-model/amazon.titan-embed-text-v2:0"
]
```

Cross-region inference profiles (`us.*` prefix) route through multiple regions. The `arn:aws:bedrock:us-east-1::` ARN does not match cross-region calls → `AccessDeniedException`.

**Fix:** Updated to `"Resource": "*"` for `bedrock:InvokeModel`. This is the documented requirement for cross-region inference profiles and is consistent with AWS's own examples.

#### VPC Removal Fix (Same Pattern as Evidence Lambda)

Both `veloquity-evidence-dev` and `veloquity-reasoning-dev` were created by CloudFormation with a private VPC configuration (two private subnets, one security group). The VPC had no NAT Gateway — meaning outbound internet traffic (to Bedrock API, Secrets Manager, S3) was blocked.

**Symptom:** Lambda invocations timed out after 60 seconds with `Read timeout on endpoint URL`.

**Fix (applied to both Lambdas):**
```bash
aws lambda update-function-configuration \
  --function-name veloquity-reasoning-dev \
  --vpc-config SubnetIds=[],SecurityGroupIds=[]
```
Empty arrays remove the VPC configuration, restoring default Lambda networking (outbound internet via AWS managed NAT).

**Root cause:** CloudFormation stack attached the Lambda to the VPC for RDS access, but RDS has a public endpoint (`veloquity-dev.ckh6ce2aesni.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com`). VPC placement was unnecessary for MVP and blocked all external service calls.

### reasoning_runs Audit Table Design

**Migration:** `db/migrations/007_create_reasoning_runs.sql`

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS reasoning_runs (
    id               UUID        PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    run_at           TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    evidence_ids     UUID[]      NOT NULL,       -- which evidence was reasoned over
    priority_scores  JSONB       NOT NULL,       -- full scored evidence payload
    llm_response     JSONB       NOT NULL,       -- raw LLM output
    model_id         TEXT        NOT NULL,       -- model used
    token_usage      JSONB       NOT NULL,       -- {input_tokens, output_tokens}
    status           TEXT        NOT NULL DEFAULT 'completed',
    s3_report_key    TEXT                         -- set after S3 upload
);

CREATE INDEX idx_reasoning_runs_run_at ON reasoning_runs(run_at DESC);
```

**S3 report:** Full run payload written to `reasoning-runs/{run_id}.json` in `veloquity-reports-dev-082228066878`. The `s3_report_key` column is back-filled after upload.

### Results from Final Lambda Invocation

```
run_id          : 36e6e792-bd3c-479f-b248-c5094d7a9bae
evidence_count  : 4
recommendations : 4
token_usage     : 1058 in / 781 out
s3_report_key   : reasoning-runs/36e6e792-bd3c-479f-b248-c5094d7a9bae.json
statusCode      : 200
```

**Recommendations generated:**

| Rank | Theme | Effort | Impact |
|------|-------|--------|--------|
| 1 | App crashes when switching between projects | high | high |
| 2 | Black screen on launch after latest update | medium | high |
| 3 | No onboarding checklist (starting from scratch) | medium | medium |
| 4 | Dashboard load times 2s → 12s after v2.4 release | medium | medium |

### What Was Verified

## 5. Phase 4: Governance + Output

### What Was Built

**Files created:**

| File | Key Functions |
|------|---------------|
| `governance/__init__.py` | Empty (package marker) |
| `governance/audit_log.py` | `write_audit_entry(conn, event_type, details, target_id)` |
| `governance/stale_detection.py` | `detect_and_flag_stale(conn)` — 30-day threshold |
| `governance/signal_promotion.py` | `promote_staging_signals(conn)` — frequency ≥ 10 |
| `governance/cost_monitor.py` | `check_cost_signals(conn)` — cache vs evidence count |
| `governance/governance_lambda.py` | `handler(event, context)` — Lambda entry point |
| `output/__init__.py` | Empty (package marker) |
| `output/html_report.py` | `generate_and_upload(conn, s3_client, bucket_name)` |
| `db/seed/run_phase4.py` | Local test runner (direct RDS connection) |

**Lambda deployed:** `veloquity-governance-dev`
**Handler:** `governance.governance_lambda.handler`
**EventBridge rule:** `veloquity-governance-daily` — `cron(0 6 * * ? *)` (06:00 UTC daily)

### Governance Decision-Tree Logic (Not LLM)

CLAUDE.md explicitly states: "NOT an LLM agent. Decision-tree logic only."

**Why this matters:** LLM calls cost money and introduce non-determinism. Governance actions (flagging stale evidence, promoting signals, cost alerts) are purely threshold-based — they have no ambiguity that requires LLM judgment. Making them deterministic means:
- The same DB state always produces the same governance actions.
- No per-invocation Bedrock cost.
- Governance runs in 1-3 seconds (DB queries only).
- Behavior can be audited by reading the code, not by interpreting LLM reasoning.

### Three Governance Checks

#### 1. Stale Detection (`governance/stale_detection.py:detect_and_flag_stale`)

```sql
SELECT id, theme, last_validated_at
FROM evidence
WHERE status = 'active'
  AND last_validated_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
```

For each stale row:
- `UPDATE evidence SET status = 'stale' WHERE id = <id>`
- `write_audit_entry(conn, event_type='stale_flagged', target_id=id, details={theme, days_stale})`
- `conn.commit()`

Returns list of flagged dicts: `{id, theme, days_stale}`.

**Result at Phase 4 invocation:** 0 stale clusters (all 4 evidence records were created on 2026-03-08, same day as invocation).

#### 2. Signal Promotion (`governance/signal_promotion.py:promote_staging_signals`)

```sql
SELECT id, raw_text_sample, cluster_size, confidence_score, frequency, source
FROM low_confidence_staging
WHERE frequency >= 10 AND promoted = FALSE
```

For each promotable row:
- INSERT into `evidence` with `status='active'`, using `raw_text_sample` as theme.
- `UPDATE low_confidence_staging SET promoted = TRUE, promoted_at = NOW() WHERE id = <id>`
- `write_audit_entry(conn, event_type='signal_promoted', ...)`

**Result at Phase 4 invocation:** 0 promotions (no staging rows with `frequency >= 10`; all staging items had `frequency = 1`).

#### 3. Cost Monitor (`governance/cost_monitor.py:check_cost_signals`)

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM embedding_cache;    -- 55
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM evidence;           -- 4
```

```python
alert_triggered = evidence_count > 0 and cache_count < evidence_count * 0.40
```

**Result at Phase 4 invocation:** `alert_triggered = False` — 55 cache rows far exceed 40% of 4 evidence rows.

### audit_log.py as Single Write Point

**Design:** No governance module directly executes `INSERT INTO governance_log`. All modules call `write_audit_entry()`, which centralizes:
- Column name consistency (actual schema uses `event_type`, `details`, `actioned_at` — not `action`, `detail`, `run_at` as the original spec described)
- JSON serialization of the `details` dict
- The `%s::uuid` cast for nullable `target_id`

```python
def write_audit_entry(conn, event_type, details=None, target_id=None):
    with conn.cursor() as cur:
        cur.execute(
            "INSERT INTO governance_log (event_type, target_id, details) VALUES (%s, %s::uuid, %s::jsonb)",
            (event_type, target_id, json.dumps(details or {})),
        )
```

**Why this design:** If the governance_log schema changes (e.g., adding a `triggered_by` column), only `audit_log.py` needs updating — not every governance module.

### EventBridge Daily Cron Setup

```bash
aws events put-rule \
  --name veloquity-governance-daily \
  --schedule-expression "cron(0 6 * * ? *)" \
  --state ENABLED

aws events put-targets \
  --rule veloquity-governance-daily \
  --targets "Id=governance-lambda,Arn=arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:082228066878:function:veloquity-governance-dev"

aws lambda add-permission \
  --function-name veloquity-governance-dev \
  --statement-id eventbridge-daily \
  --action lambda:InvokeFunction \
  --principal events.amazonaws.com \
  --source-arn arn:aws:events:us-east-1:082228066878:rule/veloquity-governance-daily
```

Governance runs at 06:00 UTC every day. EventBridge passes the event to Lambda; the `handler` ignores the event payload (unused).

### HTML Report Design and S3 Upload

**Function:** `output/html_report.py:generate_and_upload(conn, s3_client, bucket_name)`

**Data queried:**
1. Latest `reasoning_runs` row (id, run_at, llm_response, priority_scores, token_usage)
2. All active `evidence` rows (confidence bars, source lineage, user counts)
3. Last 10 `governance_log` entries (activity timeline)

**Report sections:**
1. **Header** — run ID, timestamp, "Phase 4 Complete" badge
2. **Prioritized Recommendations** — one card per recommendation with rank badge, theme, action, effort/impact pills (color-coded green/amber/red), tradeoff explanation, risk flags
3. **Evidence Clusters** — table with inline confidence bars (green ≥ 0.8, amber ≥ 0.6, red < 0.6), user count, source lineage badges, last validated date
4. **Governance Activity** — timeline of last 10 governance log entries with icons and detail JSON
5. **System Stats** — grid cards showing active cluster count, token usage in/out, generation timestamp

**Key design choices:**
- Self-contained HTML: zero external dependencies (no CDN links, no fonts, no JS libraries)
- Dark background (`#0f1117`), system-ui font
- All styles in a single `<style>` block
- `_esc()` function HTML-escapes all dynamic content to prevent XSS

**S3 upload:** Key is always `reports/latest.html` — the report overwrites the previous one.

### S3 ACL Fallback to Pre-Signed URL

**Why this was needed:** The S3 bucket `veloquity-reports-dev-082228066878` was created with **Object Ownership: BucketOwnerEnforced**, which disables ACLs entirely. The first upload attempt:

```
botocore.exceptions.ClientError: AccessControlListNotSupported:
The bucket does not allow ACLs
```

**Fallback logic in `html_report.py`:**
```python
try:
    s3_client.put_object(..., ACL="public-read")
    url = f"https://{bucket_name}.s3.amazonaws.com/{_S3_KEY}"
except ClientError as exc:
    if exc.response["Error"]["Code"] in (
        "AccessDenied", "AllAccessDisabled", "AccessControlListNotSupported"
    ):
        s3_client.put_object(...)  # without ACL
        url = s3_client.generate_presigned_url(
            "get_object",
            Params={"Bucket": bucket_name, "Key": _S3_KEY},
            ExpiresIn=86400,  # 24 hours
        )
```

The three error codes cover all known ACL rejection scenarios:
- `AccessControlListNotSupported` — bucket has ACLs disabled (this project)
- `AccessDenied` — IAM policy blocks public-read ACL
- `AllAccessDisabled` — public access block enabled

### governance_log Actual Schema vs Planned Schema

The original spec described columns: `id, action, target_id, detail, run_at, triggered_by`.

**Actual schema (from migration `006_create_governance_log.sql`):**

| Planned Column | Actual Column | Notes |
|----------------|---------------|-------|
| `action` | `event_type` | Has CHECK constraint limiting to known event types |
| `detail` | `details` | JSONB with default `'{}'` |
| `run_at` | `actioned_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ with DEFAULT NOW() |
| `triggered_by` | *(does not exist)* | Not in actual migration |

The governance code was written to match the actual schema. The spec's column names were not used.

**Known event types (from CHECK constraint):**
- `stale_detected`, `signal_promoted`, `reprocess_triggered`, `cost_alert`, `threshold_alert`, `cache_purge`, `duplicate_pattern_flagged`

Note: Phase 4 code uses `stale_flagged` (not `stale_detected`) — this will cause a CHECK constraint violation in production. The `stale_detection.py` module uses `event_type='stale_flagged'` which is not in the allowed set. For production, either the migration CHECK constraint must be updated or the code must be changed to use `stale_detected`.

### Test Count and Pass Rate

**Test file:** `tests/test_governance.py`
**Test classes and counts:**

| Class | Tests | Coverage |
|-------|-------|----------|
| `TestWriteAuditEntry` | 3 | Correct INSERT values, nullable target_id, empty details default |
| `TestDetectAndFlagStale` | 6 | Empty → [], UPDATE called, days_stale calculated, audit entry written, correct keys, commit per row |
| `TestPromoteStagingSignals` | 5 | Empty → [], INSERT into evidence, marks promoted=TRUE, audit entry written, correct keys |
| `TestCheckCostSignals` | 5 | No alert when cache adequate, alert when cache low (+ audit entry), no alert when evidence=0, correct keys, correct count values |
| `TestHtmlReport` | 6 | Returns URL string, S3 put called, presigned URL fallback on AccessDenied, HTML contains recommendation theme, HTML contains evidence theme, _esc prevents XSS |

**Total: 25 tests, 100% passing.**

### Results from Final Lambda Invocation

```
Function:          veloquity-governance-dev
statusCode:        200
stale_flagged:     0

| Docs | `pages/Docs.tsx` | Sticky TOC, 7 sections covering product vision, architecture, evidence intelligence, recommendations, governance, infrastructure, key design decisions |

- **Build output:** `frontend/dist/` — production build clean, 0 TypeScript errors

### Fixes Applied During Phase 5 Verification

| File | Fix |
|------|-----|
| `api/routes/agents.py` | Guarded `fetchone()` against `None` returns |
| `api/routes/governance.py` | Added `_count()` helper; added `last_24h`, `last_7d`, `events_by_type` fields |

### Deployment Config

- **`render.yaml`:** Render web service for FastAPI (`rootDir: api`, `startCommand: uvicorn api.main:app`)
- **`vercel.json`:** Vercel static deploy for React (`outputDirectory: frontend/dist`, SPA rewrites)

### All Known Issues Resolved

- **TEXT[]→JSONB migration for representative_quotes:** COMPLETE. 4 rows migrated. Column is now JSONB with `{text, source}` dict format. Verified 2026-03-10.

- **governance_log CHECK constraint:** COMPLETE. Old constraint (7 values, missing `stale_flagged`) dropped and replaced with new constraint (9 values including both `stale_detected` and `stale_flagged`). Verified 2026-03-10.

### Frontend UI Updates (2026-03-10)

- **Logo integration:** Veloquity logo (`logo.png`) added to sidebar top and topbar on every page. `onError` fallback to text if image missing.

- **Version badge removed:** "v1.0.0 MVP" badge removed from sidebar bottom.

- **Agents page — vertical pipeline diagram** replacing horizontal layout:
  - Source nodes: "App Store Reviews" + "Zendesk Tickets"
  - 4 agent nodes in vertical flow with connecting arrows
  - Each node shows: display name, relative last run time, coloured CSS status dot (green = last 7 days, amber = 7–30 days, red = >30 days or never)
  - Output node: "Product Recommendations"
  - Driven by live `agentMap` data from API — no extra calls

- **Build output after updates:** 244.42 kB JS, 13.21 kB CSS, built in 19.76s, zero TypeScript errors

### Agents Page — Pipeline Detail

The Agents page renders a vertical, end-to-end pipeline diagram followed by individual agent cards:

**Pipeline flow (top → bottom):**
```
[ App Store Reviews ]  [ Zendesk Tickets ]
            ↓
    Ingestion Agent
    veloquity-ingestion-dev
    PII Redaction · Dedup · SHA-256 · S3 Landing
            ↓
    Evidence Intelligence
    veloquity-evidence-dev
    Titan Embed V2 · pgvector · Cosine Clustering 0.6
            ↓
    Reasoning Agent
    veloquity-reasoning-dev
    Confidence Scoring · Claude 3 Haiku · Bedrock
            ↓
    Governance Agent
    veloquity-governance-dev
    Stale Detection · EventBridge 06:00 UTC
            ↓
    [ Product Decisions — Prioritized · Traceable ]
```

Each pipeline node shows: display name, tech subtitle, last run time (relative), coloured CSS status dot (green = last 7 days, amber = 7–30 days, red = >30 days or never run), and a **Run** button.

Below the pipeline, four agent cards show: lambda function name (monospace), description, tech tags, run count, last run time, last run JSON payload (if triggered this session), and a **Run Agent** gradient button.

All run buttons call `POST /api/v1/agents/{lambdaName}/run` using the full lambda name (e.g. `veloquity-ingestion-dev`). Status is managed via local `runStatus` state; only one agent can run at a time (`anyRunning` guard).

### Mock Data Summary (`mockData.ts`)

| Export | Records | Purpose |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `MOCK_EVIDENCE` | 4 clusters | Evidence grid, confidence scores pages |
| `MOCK_RECOMMENDATIONS` | 4 ranked items | Decision playground page |
| `MOCK_AGENTS` | 4 agents | Agents page (pipeline + cards) |
| `MOCK_GOVERNANCE` | 5 events | Dashboard governance log widget |
| `MOCK_STATS` | 1 object | Dashboard summary stats (7 fields) |

All mock data matches the exact shape of the live API response types. Pages use `useState(MOCK_DATA)` initialisation so they render immediately without a network call, then `useEffect` tries the real API and silently falls back if the response is empty or errors.

## 7. Strategic Decisions & Deviations

A complete table of every deviation from the original CLAUDE.md spec:

| Component | Original Plan | What Was Built | Reason |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|--------|
| PII Redaction | AWS Comprehend (`comprehend:DetectPIIEntities`) | stdlib regex in `pii_redaction.py` (6 patterns) | Cost (per-character billing) + IAM complexity |
| Vector DB | OpenSearch Serverless | pgvector on existing RDS | $172/month floor cost for OpenSearch vs $0 incremental for pgvector |
| RDS instance type | t3.medium | t2.micro | MVP cost minimization; t2.micro handles this data volume |
| Embedding dims | 1536 (V1 assumption in original migrations) | 1024 (Titan Embed V2 actual output) | V2 model produces 1024-dim vectors; migration corrected |
| Clustering algorithm | HNSW index (pgvector) | Greedy O(N×C) cosine similarity (pure Python) | HNSW is a retrieval index, not a clustering algorithm; greedy approach is correct tool for this task |
| Embedding cache | Redis/ElastiCache | PostgreSQL `embedding_cache` table | No new services; PostgreSQL is already present; fast enough at MVP scale |
| Reasoning model | Claude Sonnet (`anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0`) | Claude 3 Haiku (`anthropic.claude-3-haiku-20240307-v1:0`) | Sonnet marked legacy; Claude 3.5 Haiku cross-region issues (us-east-2 approval needed) |
| Reasoning approach | Full ReAct tool-calling loop with `get_evidence()`, `get_constraints()`, `get_source_lineage()` | Single structured prompt with all evidence pre-loaded | MVP speed; avoids multi-turn Bedrock calls; deterministic scorer provides auditability |
| Output | Slack digest (`output/slack_digest.py`) | S3 HTML report (`output/html_report.py`) | No Slack webhook configured; HTML report is immediately viewable by any stakeholder |
| FastAPI layer | `api/app.py` + routes | Full FastAPI layer built in Phase 5: `api/main.py`, `api/dependencies.py`, `api/schemas.py`, 6 route files, 10 endpoints | Phase 5 complete |
| Lambda networking | VPC-attached (private subnets) | No VPC (AWS managed NAT) | Private subnets without NAT Gateway blocked all outbound calls to Bedrock/Secrets Manager/S3 |
| governance_log columns | `action, detail, run_at, triggered_by` | `event_type, details, actioned_at` (no triggered_by) | Actual migration schema differed from spec; code written to match DB reality |

### Lambda Configuration Summary

| Lambda | Handler | Runtime | Timeout | Memory | Env Vars |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|--------|----------|
| `veloquity-ingestion-dev` | `ingestion.lambda_handler.handler` | python3.12 | 60s | 256 MB | `AWS_REGION_NAME`, `S3_RAW_BUCKET`, `DB_SECRET_ARN` |
| `veloquity-evidence-dev` | `evidence.embedding_pipeline.handler` | python3.12 | 300s | 512 MB | `AWS_REGION_NAME`, `S3_RAW_BUCKET`, `DB_SECRET_ARN`, `BEDROCK_EMBED_MODEL` |
| `veloquity-reasoning-dev` | `lambda_reasoning.handler.handler` | python3.12 | 120s | 256 MB | `AWS_REGION_NAME`, `DB_SECRET_ARN`, `BEDROCK_LLM_MODEL=anthropic.claude-3-haiku-20240307-v1:0` |
| `veloquity-governance-dev` | `governance.governance_lambda.handler` | python3.12 | 60s | 256 MB | `AWS_REGION_NAME`, `DB_SECRET_ARN`, `REPORTS_BUCKET` |

### IAM Policy Evolution

**Original policy** (from CloudFormation stack):
```json
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": ["bedrock:InvokeModel"],
  "Resource": [
    "arn:aws:bedrock:us-east-1::foundation-model/anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0",
    "arn:aws:bedrock:us-east-1::foundation-model/amazon.titan-embed-text-v2:0"
  ]
}
```

**Problem:** Cross-region inference profiles (e.g., `us.anthropic.claude-3-5-haiku-20241022-v1:0`) route through multiple regions. The region-specific ARN doesn't match cross-region calls → `AccessDeniedException`.

**Updated policy (Phase 3 fix):**
```json
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": ["bedrock:InvokeModel"],
  "Resource": "*"
}
```

Required by AWS documentation for cross-region inference profile invocations. With the final model choice (`anthropic.claude-3-haiku-20240307-v1:0` — direct on-demand, no inference profile), the wildcard is still in place but technically the region-specific ARN would work.

### VPC Removal Pattern

Applied to both `veloquity-evidence-dev` (Phase 2) and `veloquity-reasoning-dev` (Phase 3), and proactively to `veloquity-governance-dev` immediately after creation (Phase 4).

**Detection:** Check `VpcConfig.SubnetIds` after Lambda creation. If non-empty, remove immediately.

**Fix:**
```bash
aws lambda update-function-configuration \
  --function-name <function-name> \
  --vpc-config SubnetIds=[],SecurityGroupIds=[] \
  --region us-east-1
aws lambda wait function-updated --function-name <function-name>
```

**Root cause:** CloudFormation stack attached Lambdas to a VPC for RDS access, but the RDS instance has a public endpoint. Private subnet placement blocked all outbound calls to AWS services (Bedrock, Secrets Manager, S3) because no NAT Gateway was provisioned.

## 10. Gaps Remaining

| Gap | Description | Priority |
|-----|-------------|----------|
| `stale_flagged` event type | governance_log CHECK constraint allows `stale_detected` not `stale_flagged` — will fail at production scale | **RESOLVED** |
| TEXT[]→JSONB migration | `representative_quotes` in existing evidence rows is TEXT[]; API normalises at read time via `_normalize_quotes()` but column should be migrated to JSONB. Migration SQL in Phase 5 section. | **RESOLVED** |
| Deploy `frontend_final` to Vercel | Update `vercel.json` `outputDirectory` to `frontend_final/dist`, push to GitHub, import in Vercel dashboard | Medium |
| Set `FRONTEND_URL` on Render | After Vercel deployment is live, copy exact Vercel URL → set as `FRONTEND_URL` env var on Render service to allow CORS | Medium |
| Lock down RDS security group | After confirming Render→RDS connectivity, restrict inbound 5432 to Render static egress IPs only | Medium |
| evidence_item_map backfill | The 4 evidence clusters from Phase 2 have zero rows in `evidence_item_map`. Re-running the embedding pipeline against the existing S3 corpus will populate them. | Low |
| staging_item_map table | `write_staging` does not write item map entries. Promoted clusters get best-effort recovery via `_recover_item_map` (queries dedup_index only). Full provenance for staging rows requires a dedicated `staging_item_map` table (future iteration). | Low |
| ReAct tool-calling loop | Current reasoning is a single prompt; CLAUDE.md spec calls for dynamic tool-calling (get_evidence, get_constraints, get_source_lineage) | Medium |
| Permanent S3 HTML URL | Pre-signed URLs expire in 24h; enabling public access or using CloudFront would give a permanent URL | Medium |
| Seed data scale | 165 items is sufficient to prove the pipeline but not to test at realistic volume (target: 500+ per source) | Low |
| `output/slack_digest.py` | Stub file; Slack integration not implemented | Low (HTML report is sufficient for MVP) |
| `reasoning/tools.py` | Stub file; tool definitions for future ReAct loop | Low |
| `reasoning/output_schema.py` | Stub file; formal Pydantic schema for LLM output validation | Low |
| Governance alert → reprocessing | governance_log records `reprocess_triggered` event type but no reprocessing pipeline exists yet | Future |
| Temporal decay on write | CLAUDE.md specifies computing `temporal_decay_weight` at query time; currently the column is set but decay formula is applied in the scorer, not stored | Low |

### Cloud Deployment — Render (API) + Vercel (Frontend)

#### Step 1 — AWS IAM Setup

Create a dedicated IAM user `veloquity-api` with a programmatic access key. Attach an inline policy granting:
- `bedrock:InvokeModel` on `arn:aws:bedrock:*::foundation-model/*`
- `lambda:InvokeFunction` on `arn:aws:lambda:*:*:function:veloquity-*`
- `secretsmanager:GetSecretValue` on the DB secret ARN

Save the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` — they are set as Render env vars.

#### Step 2 — RDS Security Group

In the AWS Console, edit the RDS instance's security group inbound rules:
- Port 5432, source: your local IP (for migration runs)
- Port 5432, source: Render static egress IPs (added after Render service is deployed)

Do **not** set source to `0.0.0.0/0`.

#### Step 3 — Deploy API to Render

Create `render.yaml` in the repo root (or configure via Render dashboard):

```yaml
services:
  - type: web
    name: veloquity-api
    env: python
    rootDir: api
    buildCommand: pip install -r ../requirements.txt
    startCommand: uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT
    envVars:
      - key: DB_HOST
        sync: false
      - key: DB_PORT
        value: "5432"
      - key: DB_NAME
        value: veloquity
      - key: DB_USER
        sync: false
      - key: DB_PASSWORD
        sync: false
      - key: AWS_REGION_NAME
        value: us-east-1
      - key: AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
        sync: false
      - key: AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
        sync: false
      - key: FRONTEND_URL
        sync: false
      - key: BEDROCK_LLM_MODEL
        value: anthropic.claude-3-haiku-20240307-v1:0
      - key: BEDROCK_EMBED_MODEL
        value: amazon.titan-embed-text-v2:0
```

Push to GitHub. In Render, **New → Web Service → Connect repo**. Set all `sync: false` env vars in the Render dashboard. Note the service URL (e.g. `https://veloquity-api.onrender.com`).

#### Step 4 — Deploy Frontend to Vercel

Update `frontend_final/vercel.json` to ensure output directory is correct:

```json
{
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "dist",
  "rewrites": [{ "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/index.html" }]
}
```

In Vercel dashboard: **New Project → Import Git Repository → set Root Directory to `frontend_final`**.

Set environment variable:
- `VITE_API_URL` = `https://veloquity-api.onrender.com` (your Render URL)

Deploy. Note the Vercel URL (e.g. `https://veloquity.vercel.app`).

#### Step 5 — Cross-connect: Set FRONTEND_URL on Render

In Render dashboard → veloquity-api → Environment:
- Set `FRONTEND_URL` = exact Vercel URL (e.g. `https://veloquity.vercel.app`)
- **Redeploy** the Render service so CORS picks up the new value.

#### Step 6 — Production Verification

| Check | How |
|-------|-----|
| API health | `GET https://veloquity-api.onrender.com/health` → `{"status":"ok"}` |
| CORS | Open browser DevTools on Vercel URL; confirm no CORS errors on API calls |
| Dashboard loads | Evidence clusters and stats populate (not mock data) |
| Chat works | Type a question; confirm streaming response from Bedrock |
| Run Agent | Click Run on any agent card; confirm 200 response + status update |
| Governance log | Dashboard shows governance events from last DB run |

#### Known Production Notes

- **Render free tier** spins down after 15 min of inactivity. First request after spindown takes ~30s. Use a paid plan or configure a keep-alive ping for demos.
- **Vercel free tier** is sufficient for this frontend (static SPA, no serverless functions used).
- **Bedrock in `us-east-1`** — ensure your IAM user and Render env vars both use `us-east-1`. Bedrock model availability varies by region.
- **DB migrations on RDS** — run migrations from a machine whose IP is in the RDS security group inbound rules, or from a bastion host.
